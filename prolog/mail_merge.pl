/** <module> Perform Mail Merge

This module provides a  simple  means  to  perform mail merge from a Prolog
application: send personalized email message to a list of recipients.
  Here is a simple example:

==
mail_merge('Hello ~s how are you?',[['gianni@abc.com','Gianni'],
  ['stefi@cde.com','Stefi']],
  [subject('Hello'),from('Fabrizo'),auth(<google_user>-<google_password>)]).
==
*/

%!  mail_merge(+Message:atom_or_string,+Addresses:list,+Options:list) is det
%
%   Perform mail merge using SMTP. 
%   Message is a format string as in format/2, Addresses is a list of lists, each sublist is of the form
%   =[To|Fields]= where To is the recipient of the message and Fields contain the values to replace placeholders in Message. 
%   Message and Fields are passed to format/2 to produce the message. Options are passed to smtp_send_mail/3 from package
%   smtp, they are:
%
%     * smtp(+Host)
%       the name or ip address for smtp host, eg. swi-prolog.org
%     * from(+FromAddress)
%       atomic identifies sender address.  Provides the default
%       for header(from(From)).
%     * date(+Date)
%       Set the date header.  Default is to use the current time.
%     * subject(+Subject)
%       atomic: text for 'Subject:' email header
%     * auth(User-Password)
%       authentication credentials, as atoms or strings.
%     * auth_method(+PlainOrLoginOrNone)
%       type of authentication. Default is =default=, alternatives
%       are =plain= and =login=
%     * security(Security)
%       one of: `none`, `ssl`, `tls`, `starttls`
%     * content_type(+ContentType)
%       sets =|Content-Type|= header
%     * mailed_by(By)
%       add =|X-Mailer: SWI-Prolog <version>, pack(smtp)|= to header iff By is true
%     * header(Name(Val))
%       add HName: Val to headers. HName is Name if Name's first
%       letter is a capital, and it is Name after capitalising its
%       first letter otherwise. For instance header(from('My name,
%       me@server.org')) adds header "From: My name, my@server.org"
%       and header('FOO'(bar)) adds "FOO: bar"
%
%   Defaults are provided by settings associated to this module. host, port, security and auth_method are 
%   set by default to the values needed by gmail. If you use your gmail account you should just provide 
%   the option auth(<google_user>-<google_password>)
%   You should also make sure that your google account has the option "Allow less secure apps" set to on.
%   You can find the option in your account page under Apps with account access.
